## YOLO-based Vehicle Detection

This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for real-time vehicle detection. YOLO is known for its speed and accuracy, making it ideal for tasks like vehicle detection in various scenarios, such as traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, and surveillance.

## Project Overview

- **Model:** YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **Objective:** Detect and classify vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, buses) in images or video streams.
- **Dataset:** Pre-trained YOLO models can be fine-tuned on specific vehicle datasets, or you can use standard YOLO models trained on COCO or other datasets.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Load images or video streams for vehicle detection.
   - If using a custom dataset, ensure it is annotated with bounding boxes and labels.

2. **YOLO Model Implementation:**
   - Load the pre-trained YOLO model (e.g., YOLOv3, YOLOv4, or YOLOv5).
   - Configure the model for the specific task of vehicle detection.

3. **Detection and Classification:**
   - Use the YOLO model to detect vehicles in the input images or video streams.
   - The model outputs bounding boxes and class probabilities for each detected vehicle.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize the results with bounding boxes drawn on detected vehicles.

5. **Optimization (Optional):**
   - Fine-tune the YOLO model on a custom dataset to improve detection accuracy for specific vehicle types or conditions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on the YOLO version)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolo-vehicle-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd yolo-vehicle-detection
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook YOLO_VEHICLE_DETECTION.ipynb
```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the model, run detection, and evaluate results.

## Results

The YOLO-based vehicle detection system is capable of detecting and classifying vehicles in real-time. The results include bounding boxes around detected vehicles, and the model's performance is reported using evaluation metrics.
